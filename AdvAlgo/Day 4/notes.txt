pseudocode of Floyd Warshal


1.  Initialization: A matrix 'dist' ith infinity values

Let dist be a |V| x |V| array of min distances initialized to infonity

2.  Iterating through vertices
    for each vertex V
        dist[v][v] = 0
3.   for each edge ege (u,v):
        dist[u][v] = weight of edge (u,v)

4. for k from 1 to |V|
        for i from 1 to |V|
            for j from 1 to |V|
                if dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]:
                    dist[i][j]  dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] 




Why Do we need Floyd Warshall Algorithm?
1. Optimize Network Efficiency: By defining the shortest paths across all the networks, we can optimize the cost or reduce the overhead of the resources.
2. Solving Complex Problems: Traffic Management in telecommunication field, wireless sensor networks, logistical problems.
3. Facilitate Decision Making in business, science, education, by
â€¢ making datasets more efficient and operational networks.
Real World Applications:
1. Social Networking Services
2. Robotics and Autonomous Vehicles
3. Urban Traffic Management
4. For dense graphs and negative graphs, this algo works well.
[Hassan] | will be creating a discussion on Canvas for individuals, highligthing the real world applications, at least two and identify why Floyd Warshall Algo will fit in?
